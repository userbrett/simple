INTRODUCTION
======================================================================

Welcome to the sIMpLe project, a simple way to provision
a Lustre file system using Intel Manager for Lustre (IML).

The files in this directory will create a Lustre VM system
under KVM in less than an hour.  You can reprovision those
same VM nodes in about 15 minutes.

Contained within this project are five (5) scripts:

    1. setup.sh - create the VMs
    2. startup.sh - start the VMs
    3. stop.sh - stop the VMs
    4. destroy.sh - destroy (pull the plug on) the VMs
    5. delete.sh - delete the VMs and Targets

Before creating the Virtual Lustre environment, a VM image must exist in
this directory.  It must be named, or sym-linked to as, "ee.img".  That
image will be used to create all the required nodes.

To create a VM image, please see README.create.vm.txt.

Once the VM image is created:

    a.  Copy it into the "ee.lustre.vm" directory as "ee.img".
    b.  cd into the ee.lustre.vm directory.
    c.  Run ./setup.sh to create the environment, and then
        run ./startup.sh to start the VMs.
    d.  Next, follow the instructions in README.poststart.

To clean up, run:

    a.  Run ./destroy.sh to power off the VMs.
    b.  Run ./delete.sh to remove the VMs, targets and networks.

The VM system is created as follows:
                                                
    VM		MAC Address		RAM	SIZE
    ------------------------------------------------------
    IML ee.iml	52:54:00:00:0x:01	2 GB 	4 GB
    MGS ee.mgs	52:54:00:00:0x:02	1 GB 	4 GB
    MDS ee.mds	52:54:00:00:0x:03	1 GB 	4 GB
    OSS ee.oss1	52:54:00:00:0x:04	1 GB 	4 GB
    OSS ee.oss2	52:54:00:00:0x:05	1 GB 	4 GB
    CLI ee.cli	52:54:00:00:0x:06	1 GB 	4 GB

The MAC addresses correspond to the interface, in that 
on eth0 the x will be 0, on eth1 the x will be 1, and
on eth2 the x will be 2.

Lustre Storage Targets and Sizes are:

    MGT   100 MB
    MDT0    5 GB
    MDT1    5 GB
    OST0    5 GB
    OST1    5 GB
    OST2    5 GB
    OST3    5 GB

Can the MDT/OST targets be decreased?  At the time this project
was created, there were some fixed values in IML preventing the use
of smaller storage targets.

Expectations for the KVM host:
------------------------------------------------------
1.  A CentOS 6 server with functional KVM support.
2.  KVM node has sufficient RAM - 16GB or more.
3.  KVM node has sufficient CPU.
    - Built/tested using 1 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz.
4.  KVM node has 60GB+ of free space in the project directory.
5.  The bridge, br0, must be present on the KVM node.
6.  DHCP will provide IP addresses to each VM eth0 interface via br0.
7.  Forward and reverse DNS are configured for eth0 on all the VMs.
